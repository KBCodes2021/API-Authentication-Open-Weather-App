# API-Authentication-Open-Weather-App

Uses Open Weather API to send a text with Twillio SMS API. This was automated with PythonAutomate.com to routinely happen when weather is windy. I hid the ENV files in PythonAutomate.com. Had trouble doing the same in Pycharm. my notes go into further detail.

All API/Phone numbers have been removed, and remain in the source project
